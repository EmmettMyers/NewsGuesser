<b>NewsGuesser is a web game in which users have 2 minutes to guess as many words in a news article as possible from seeing only its picture and title.</b><br>
  
The longer the word and the more times it appears in the article, the more points you receive.<br>
Users can play normal mode (pulls random news articles) or topics mode (pulls news articles based on a topic the user selects).

The server pulls news article data from NewsAPI, then the client-side parses the data to use for the game.<br>

  <b>Tools used:</b>
